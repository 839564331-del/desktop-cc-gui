# conversation-realtime-cpu-stability Specification

## Purpose

Defines the conversation-realtime-cpu-stability behavior contract, covering Lossless Realtime Event Micro-Batching.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Lossless Realtime Event Micro-Batching

The client MUST support lossless micro-batching for high-frequency realtime conversation events to reduce dispatch/render amplification while preserving event semantics.

#### Scenario: preserve per-thread event ordering during batching
- **WHEN** high-frequency `delta` events are enqueued for the same thread
- **THEN** batched dispatch MUST preserve original relative event order
- **AND** downstream reducers MUST observe the same logical sequence as non-batched mode

#### Scenario: no event loss under burst traffic
- **WHEN** burst realtime events exceed a single frame capacity
- **THEN** the batching queue MUST flush in bounded chunks without dropping events
- **AND** every accepted event MUST be consumed exactly once by state reducers

### Requirement: Reducer No-Op Reference Stability

Thread state reducers MUST return stable references for semantically unchanged updates.

#### Scenario: unchanged update returns original state references
- **WHEN** a realtime update does not change thread-visible state
- **THEN** reducer MUST return the existing state object reference
- **AND** dependent selectors/components MUST NOT be invalidated by reference churn

#### Scenario: changed update still propagates correctly
- **WHEN** a realtime update changes thread-visible state
- **THEN** reducer MUST produce updated references for affected branches
- **AND** unchanged branches MUST retain prior references

### Requirement: Incremental Thread-Scoped Derivation

Derived conversation data MUST be recomputed incrementally by affected thread scope instead of global full replay.

#### Scenario: only affected threads are recomputed
- **WHEN** realtime updates touch a subset of threads
- **THEN** the derivation pipeline MUST recompute only affected threads
- **AND** unrelated thread-derived results MUST be reused

#### Scenario: derivation cache invalidates by thread revision
- **WHEN** an affected thread receives a new logical revision
- **THEN** the corresponding cached derivation MUST be invalidated
- **AND** stale derived results MUST NOT be served

### Requirement: Message Rendering Compute Deduplication

Message rendering MUST avoid repeated parse/transform work for unchanged item revisions.

#### Scenario: unchanged revision reuses parsed payload
- **WHEN** the renderer receives an item with unchanged revision
- **THEN** expensive parse/transform results MUST be reused
- **AND** the render path MUST NOT repeat the same computation in that frame

#### Scenario: revision change recomputes once
- **WHEN** item revision changes due to new realtime deltas
- **THEN** parse/transform MUST be recomputed once per revision
- **AND** all render consumers MUST reuse that computed result

### Requirement: Session Activity and Radar Incremental Refresh

Session activity and radar feeds MUST refresh incrementally from changed thread identities.

#### Scenario: unrelated thread updates do not trigger global rebuild
- **WHEN** a realtime update affects one thread
- **THEN** activity/radar recomputation MUST remain scoped to the changed thread set
- **AND** unrelated workspace-thread rows MUST NOT be globally rebuilt

#### Scenario: status transition updates existing identity
- **WHEN** a session event transitions from running to completed or failed
- **THEN** the feed MUST update the existing session identity entry
- **AND** the feed MUST NOT insert duplicate rows for the same workspace-thread identity

### Requirement: Performance Guardrail and Safe Rollback

Realtime CPU optimizations MUST provide observability and safe rollback controls.

#### Scenario: optimization metrics are emitted for regression comparison
- **WHEN** realtime optimization paths are active
- **THEN** the system MUST emit metrics for batching, reducer no-op hit rate, and derivation cost
- **AND** these metrics MUST support baseline vs optimized comparison

#### Scenario: layered rollback restores baseline behavior
- **WHEN** optimization regression is detected
- **THEN** operators MUST be able to disable batching/derivation/no-op guards independently
- **AND** the client MUST continue processing realtime events with baseline-compatible semantics

### Requirement: Claude Live Assistant Delta MUST Avoid Per-Delta Full Thread Derivation

Claude live assistant text updates MUST avoid full thread canonical derivation for repeated pure text deltas when the thread structure is unchanged.

#### Scenario: repeated text delta uses reducer fast path
- **WHEN** a Claude live turn appends text delta to an existing assistant message with the same item id
- **AND** the update does not introduce a new conversation item or change item kind
- **THEN** the reducer MUST update only the affected assistant item
- **AND** it MUST NOT run full `prepareThreadItems(...)` for that delta

#### Scenario: boundary events return to canonical derivation
- **WHEN** the assistant message completes, a structured item is inserted, or a legacy/canonical id migration is required
- **THEN** the reducer MUST run the canonical derivation path
- **AND** final thread items MUST preserve existing semantics for dedupe, truncation, generated image anchoring, and final metadata

#### Scenario: fast path preserves final metadata guard
- **WHEN** an existing finalized assistant message receives additional live text while the thread is still processing
- **THEN** the reducer MUST clear stale final metadata before showing the message as live again
- **AND** it MUST NOT leave a streaming assistant message marked as final

### Requirement: Gemini Live Assistant Delta MUST Use Lossless Realtime Batching
Gemini live assistant text deltas MUST participate in the same lossless realtime batching contract as other engine assistant deltas unless an explicit safety guard requires immediate dispatch.

#### Scenario: gemini assistant deltas are batched when batching is enabled
- **WHEN** realtime batching is enabled
- **AND** Gemini assistant text deltas arrive within the same flush window for the same thread
- **THEN** the client MUST buffer them through the realtime batching queue
- **AND** dispatch/render amplification MUST be reduced without losing any accepted delta

#### Scenario: gemini batching preserves processing and interruption semantics
- **WHEN** a Gemini assistant delta is buffered
- **THEN** the eventual flush MUST still ensure the thread, mark processing when appropriate, preserve original per-thread operation order, call message activity once per flush window, and respect interrupted-thread suppression
- **AND** unmount cleanup MUST flush or discard buffers according to the same lossless contract used by other engines

### Requirement: Reasoning And Tool Delta Reducers MUST Avoid Per-Chunk Full Derivation When Safe
High-frequency reasoning and tool output deltas MUST avoid full thread canonical derivation for repeated same-item updates when the thread structure is unchanged.

#### Scenario: reasoning delta updates existing live reasoning item incrementally
- **WHEN** a Claude Code, Gemini, or Codex-compatible reasoning delta appends or snapshots text for an existing reasoning item
- **AND** no item kind, item order, generated-image anchoring, ask-user normalization, exploration summary, or tool truncation boundary can change
- **THEN** the reducer MUST update only the affected reasoning item
- **AND** it MUST NOT run full `prepareThreadItems(...)` for that delta

#### Scenario: tool output delta updates existing live tool item incrementally
- **WHEN** a tool output delta appends text to an existing running tool item
- **AND** the update does not cross a truncation boundary requiring canonical tool output processing
- **THEN** the reducer MUST update only the affected tool item
- **AND** it MUST NOT run full `prepareThreadItems(...)` for that delta

#### Scenario: structural boundaries return to canonical derivation
- **WHEN** a new item is inserted, an item completes, a tool output crosses truncation policy boundaries, a generated image anchor may change, or legacy id canonicalization is required
- **THEN** the reducer MUST run the canonical derivation path
- **AND** final thread items MUST preserve existing dedupe, truncation, generated image anchoring, ask-user normalization, exploration summary, and metadata semantics

### Requirement: Normalized Realtime Assistant Events MUST Coalesce By Engine-Agnostic Safety Rules
Normalized realtime assistant events MUST be eligible for batching/coalescing based on operation and item semantics rather than Codex-only engine identity when they satisfy the same snapshot-equivalence safety contract.

#### Scenario: safe assistant snapshot events coalesce by item identity
- **WHEN** normalized realtime assistant `itemStarted` or `itemUpdated` events arrive for the same thread and item identity within one flush window
- **AND** the events are safe to replace with the latest snapshot without losing semantic ordering
- **THEN** the client MUST coalesce them by thread/item identity
- **AND** this rule MUST be available to Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini when their normalized events satisfy the same safety contract

#### Scenario: non-snapshot or completion events preserve full ordering
- **WHEN** normalized realtime events represent completion, tool/review/generated-image changes, user messages, or any non-equivalent operation
- **THEN** the client MUST preserve the full event sequence
- **AND** it MUST NOT coalesce events merely because they share an item id

### Requirement: Inactive Running Sessions MUST Use Background Render Budget
The client MUST apply a background render budget to inactive running sessions so high-frequency realtime output does not drive foreground-priority visible rendering while preserving event semantics.

#### Scenario: inactive running session does not render every output delta
- **WHEN** a session is running but is not the active visible session
- **AND** realtime output deltas continue to arrive for that session
- **THEN** the client MUST avoid rendering each output delta through high-cost visible output surfaces
- **AND** the client MUST continue updating lightweight session metadata such as running state, last activity, buffered output count, and error summary

#### Scenario: active session keeps foreground realtime rendering
- **WHEN** a running session is the active visible session
- **THEN** the client MUST preserve foreground realtime rendering for user-visible output and send-critical controls
- **AND** background render budgeting MUST NOT delay composer input, approval controls, stop controls, or visible error state

### Requirement: Background Output Buffer MUST Be Lossless And Ordered
Inactive running session output buffering MUST preserve accepted realtime event semantics while allowing render work to be flushed later in bounded chunks.

#### Scenario: buffered output converges without loss after returning foreground
- **WHEN** output events are accepted while a running session is inactive
- **AND** the user switches that session back to foreground
- **THEN** buffered output MUST converge to the same logical conversation output as foreground processing
- **AND** output MUST NOT be lost, duplicated, or reordered within the same thread, turn, and item lineage

#### Scenario: semantic boundary events are not coalesced away
- **WHEN** buffered events include completion, approval, error, tool boundary, generated image boundary, or history reconciliation events
- **THEN** the client MUST preserve those semantic boundaries
- **AND** the client MUST NOT discard them merely because adjacent output deltas are snapshot-equivalent

### Requirement: Foreground Restore MUST Flush Heavy Output In Bounded Chunks
When a background running session becomes active, heavy output restoration MUST be scheduled in bounded chunks rather than synchronously flushing all buffered render work.

#### Scenario: session shell becomes interactive before heavy output completes
- **WHEN** a background running session is switched to foreground with buffered heavy output
- **THEN** the client MUST render the interactive session shell and critical controls before completing heavy output hydration
- **AND** heavy output hydration MUST yield between chunks to avoid blocking foreground interaction

#### Scenario: restoring work yields to new user interaction
- **WHEN** heavy output hydration is in progress
- **AND** the user types, sends, stops a task, approves an action, or switches sessions again
- **THEN** the client MUST prioritize the new foreground interaction
- **AND** stale or low-priority hydration work MUST be cancelled, deferred, or resumed safely

### Requirement: Reducer Fast Path MUST Cover Streaming Completion And Upsert

The thread reducer MUST apply the same incremental derivation guard to `completeAgentMessage` and `upsertItem` as it does to the existing 5 guarded cases (`appendAgentDelta` / `appendReasoningSummary` / `appendReasoningSummaryBoundary` / `appendReasoningContent` / `appendToolOutput`). When `INCREMENTAL_DERIVATION_ENABLED` is true and the merged item is reference-equal to the existing one, the reducer MUST return the prior state object reference.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):`appendAgentDelta` already has this guard in `useThreadsReducer.ts:1068-1072`; this requirement covers the remaining streaming cases only.

#### Scenario: equivalent assistant completion returns prior state reference

- **WHEN** a `completeAgentMessage` action arrives with text that, when merged into the existing assistant item via `mergeCompletedAgentText`, produces an item that is reference-equal to the existing item
- **THEN** the reducer MUST return the prior `state` object reference
- **AND** the reducer MUST NOT invoke `prepareThreadItems` on the thread items array
- **AND** the `prepareThreadItemsCallCount` counter MUST NOT increment for that action

#### Scenario: non-equivalent assistant completion still updates state

- **WHEN** a `completeAgentMessage` action arrives with text that changes the existing assistant item
- **THEN** the reducer MUST return a new state with the updated `itemsByThread[threadId]`
- **AND** the reducer MUST invoke `fastPathForAppendAgentDelta` (or equivalent helper) to produce the new array
- **AND** downstream `useThreadSelectors` consumers MUST observe the updated items

#### Scenario: assistant upsert fast path

- **WHEN** a `upsertItem` action arrives for an item whose merged form is reference-equal to the existing item
- **THEN** the reducer MUST return the prior `state` object reference
- **AND** the reducer MUST NOT invoke `prepareThreadItems`
- **AND** `prepareThreadItemsCallCount` MUST NOT increment

### Requirement: Workspace-Scoped In-Flight Refs MUST Cleanup On Eviction

All thread-scoped in-flight refs (`pendingMemoryCaptureRef` / `pendingAssistantCompletionRef` / `recentThreadErrorsRef` / `pendingInterruptsRef` / `interruptedThreadsRef` / `handledClaudeExitPlanToolIdsRef`) MUST be keyed by `(workspaceId, threadId)`. The LRU eviction path MUST remove entries for evicted threads and MUST emit a `chat-stream/evict-thread` renderer diagnostic.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):Only the 6 core refs in this list are in scope; 5 additional `Record<string, T>` refs (`loadedThreadLastRefreshAtRef` / `historyLoadingThreadByWorkspaceRef` / `codexCompactionInFlightByThreadRef` / `sharedSessionLastSignatureByThreadRef` / `sharedSessionSyncTimerByThreadRef`) are follow-up 11.6.

#### Scenario: workspace-scoped ref stores entries per thread

- **WHEN** any of the 6 in-flight refs receives a write for `(workspaceId, threadId)`
- **THEN** the entry MUST be stored under `ref[workspaceId][threadId]`
- **AND** writes for a different `(workspaceId, threadId)` MUST NOT collide

#### Scenario: LRU eviction removes workspace-scoped entries

- **WHEN** the LRU eviction path evicts `threadId` from `loadedThreadsRef`
- **THEN** `cleanupThreadScopedRefs(workspaceId, threadId)` MUST be invoked BEFORE `dispatch({ type: "evictThreadItems" })`
- **AND** all 6 workspace-scoped refs MUST have their `(workspaceId, threadId)` entry removed
- **AND** `cleanupThreadTransientState(workspaceId, threadId)` MUST clean `turnDiagnosticsRef` / `quarantinedCodexTurnsRef` / `assistantSnapshotIngressLengthRef`
- **AND** `appendRendererDiagnostic("chat-stream/evict-thread", { workspaceId, threadId, evictedCount, cleanedRefCount })` MUST be invoked

#### Scenario: orphan ref detection after eviction

- **WHEN** an LRU eviction completes
- **THEN** `pendingMemoryCaptureRef[workspaceId]?.[threadId]` MUST be undefined
- **AND** `turnDiagnosticsRef.current.get(threadId)` MUST be undefined
- **AND** `quarantinedCodexTurnsRef.current.has(key)` MUST be false
- **AND** the test gate `S-CHAT-103/workspaceScopedRefEvictions` MUST report `0`

### Requirement: Streaming Timeline MUST Stay Virtualized

The `MessagesTimeline` virtualizer MUST remain enabled during streaming when `TIMELINE_VIRTUALIZATION_DURING_STREAMING_ENABLED` is true. The `shouldVirtualizeTimelineRows` gate MUST NOT short-circuit on `isThinking === true` for `rowCount >= 200`.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):`hasHighRenderDensity` short-circuit at `messagesTimelineVirtualization.ts:13-16` (renderWeight >= 96 AND renderWeight > rowCount * 2) MUST be preserved; this requirement only removes the `!isThinking` guard on the main branch.

#### Scenario: long conversation virtualizes during streaming

- **WHEN** `timelineProjectionRows.length >= 200` and `isThinking === true`
- **THEN** `shouldVirtualizeTimelineRows` MUST return `true`
- **AND** `useVirtualizer` MUST report `enabled: true` with `count: timelineProjectionRows.length`
- **AND** `data-timeline-virtualized="true"` MUST be present on the rendered `messages-full` element
- **AND** the rendered DOM MUST contain at most `overscan * 2 + 1` row nodes (24 * 2 + 1 = 49 for streaming overscan)

#### Scenario: virtualizer stability guard remains active

- **WHEN** streaming virtualizer is enabled and `classifyTimelineVirtualizerStability` reports `active-live-row-missing`
- **THEN** the existing bounded remeasure (cooldown 750ms) MUST trigger
- **AND** the diagnostic cooldown MUST NOT spam (5s throttle preserved)

### Requirement: Streaming Complexity Cache MUST Use Delta Scan

The streaming markdown complexity analyzer MUST expose a delta helper `analyzeStreamingMarkdownComplexityDelta(prev, prevText, deltaText)` that returns `prev` for empty `deltaText` and incrementally computes complexity for non-empty `deltaText`. The `MessageRow` component MUST use the delta helper in place of the full scan for streaming assistant messages.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):5 edge cases MUST be covered — empty delta, length jump, inside fence, cross multi-line, Chinese text.

#### Scenario: empty delta returns prev

- **WHEN** `analyzeStreamingMarkdownComplexityDelta(prev, prevText, "")` is called
- **THEN** the function MUST return `prev` reference (no allocation)
- **AND** `analyzeStreamingMarkdownComplexityCallCount` MUST NOT increment

#### Scenario: length jump increments call count once

- **WHEN** `analyzeStreamingMarkdownComplexityDelta(prev, prevText, deltaText)` is called with `deltaText.length > 0`
- **THEN** the function MUST return a new complexity object
- **AND** `analyzeStreamingMarkdownComplexityCallCount` MUST increment by 1 (not by `deltaText.length`)

#### Scenario: inside fence state preserved across delta

- **WHEN** `prev` has `insideCodeFence === true` and `deltaText` continues inside the fence
- **THEN** the returned complexity MUST count `fencedCodeLineCount` correctly
- **AND** the function MUST NOT close the fence prematurely

#### Scenario: cross multi-line delta

- **WHEN** `deltaText` contains 2+ newlines
- **THEN** the returned complexity MUST count `lineCount` correctly
- **AND** heading / list-item / fence boundaries MUST be detected across the multi-line delta

#### Scenario: Chinese text delta

- **WHEN** `deltaText` contains Chinese characters and mixed punctuation
- **THEN** the returned complexity MUST count `lineCount` correctly
- **AND** no character corruption MUST occur in `trimmedText`

### Requirement: App Server Event Subscription MUST Remain Stable Across Handler Object Changes

The `useAppServerEvents` hook MUST keep its existing `useAppServerEvents(handlers, options)` public signature. It MUST use the latest `handlers` callbacks without re-subscribing the underlying app-server event channel when the `handlers` object identity changes across renders.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):Current code already uses `handlersRef.current` inside a subscription effect with empty dependencies. The earlier multi-handlers proposal was unnecessary public API churn and is explicitly out of scope for this change.

#### Scenario: handler identity change does not resubscribe

- **WHEN** `useAppServerEvents(handlersA, options)` is mounted and the component rerenders with a different `handlersB` object reference
- **THEN** the underlying `subscribeAppServerEvents` registration MUST remain registered exactly once
- **AND** the next event MUST dispatch through `handlersB`
- **AND** unmount MUST unsubscribe exactly once

#### Scenario: multi-handlers public shape is not introduced

- **WHEN** this change is implemented
- **THEN** `useAppServerEvents` MUST NOT require or document a `{ turnLifecycle, itemStream, runtimeEvent, approvalFlow }` public shape
- **AND** existing single-handlers callers MUST require no migration

### Requirement: LRU Item Cache Cap MUST Be Adaptive To In-Flight Count

`THREAD_ITEM_CACHE_MAX` MUST be computed as `Math.max(12, inFlightCount * 2 + 6)`, where `inFlightCount` is the number of threads with `isProcessing === true` in `state.threadStatusById`. The 0 in-flight case MUST remain 12 (backward compatible).

#### Scenario: zero in-flight threads preserves 12 cap

- **WHEN** `inFlightCount === 0`
- **THEN** `computeThreadItemCacheMax(0)` MUST return `12`
- **AND** the LRU eviction behavior MUST match the pre-change constant

#### Scenario: high in-flight count expands cap

- **WHEN** `inFlightCount === 8` (e.g. 4 codex sandbox + 4 claude worktree)
- **THEN** `computeThreadItemCacheMax(8)` MUST return `22`
- **AND** the LRU eviction MUST retain at least 22 loaded threads
- **AND** no in-flight thread MUST be evicted

### Requirement: Transient RAF / Timer Refs MUST Cleanup On Thread Switch

The 7 transient RAF / timer refs in `Messages.tsx` (`scrollThrottleRef` / `assistantFinalizingTimerRef` / `anchorUpdateRafRef` / `historyStickyUpdateRafRef` / `copyTimeoutRef` / `planPanelFocusRafRef` / `planPanelFocusTimeoutRef`) MUST be cleared when the active thread changes inside the mounted `Messages` surface. The cleanup MUST be owned by `Messages`, because those refs are local to `Messages`.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):This requirement implements Option C from `design.md §6.7` (Messages-internal cleanup). The `previousActiveThreadIdRef` variant is rejected because `ref.current` changes do not trigger React renders/effects.

#### Scenario: thread switch clears previous thread timers

- **WHEN** `setActiveThreadId(threadIdB)` is called while `threadIdA` is active
- **THEN** the mounted `Messages` component MUST observe its active thread prop changing from `threadIdA` to `threadIdB`
- **AND** its local cleanup helper MUST clear all 7 RAF/timer refs for `threadIdA` (`ref.current === null` or timer cleared)
- **AND** `appendRendererDiagnostic("chat-stream/transient-timer-cleanup", { threadId: threadIdA, cleanedCount: 7 })` MUST be invoked

#### Scenario: no useThreads timer registry

- **WHEN** this change is implemented
- **THEN** `useThreads` MUST NOT expose `registerTransientTimer` or `previousActiveThreadIdRef` for `Messages` timer cleanup
- **AND** inactive thread eviction timer ownership MUST remain out of scope unless a separate runtime ownership design is added

### Requirement: In-Flight Refs MUST Honor 30-Minute TTL

`turnDiagnosticsRef` / `quarantinedCodexTurnsRef` / `assistantSnapshotIngressLengthRef` MUST support cleanup of stale settled entries. A periodic cleanup sweep MUST run on a 60-second interval, hosted in `useThreadEventHandlers.ts`, because that hook owns these refs.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):`CodexQuarantinedTurn` has `settledAt`; `TurnDiagnosticState` does not. For `turnDiagnosticsRef`, settled timestamp MUST be derived from `completedAt ?? errorAt ?? assistantCompletedAt`. `assistantSnapshotIngressLengthRef` has no timestamp and MUST be cleaned by thread-prefix when its corresponding thread diagnostic is removed or by explicit thread cleanup.

#### Scenario: 30-minute stale entry cleanup

- **WHEN** an entry in `turnDiagnosticsRef` has `completedAt`, `errorAt`, or `assistantCompletedAt` older than 30 minutes
- **THEN** the periodic cleanup sweep MUST remove the entry
- **AND** the cleanup MUST remove matching `assistantSnapshotIngressLengthRef` entries with keys prefixed by `${threadId}\0`
- **AND** the cleanup MUST NOT remove entries with a settled timestamp newer than 30 minutes
- **AND** the test gate `S-CHAT-103/workspaceScopedRefEvictions` MUST continue to report `0` orphans

#### Scenario: in-flight entry is not cleaned up

- **WHEN** an entry in `turnDiagnosticsRef` has no `completedAt`, `errorAt`, or `assistantCompletedAt` (active turn)
- **THEN** the periodic cleanup MUST NOT remove the entry
- **AND** the entry MUST remain until the turn terminates

### Requirement: Codex/Claude/Gemini/Opencode Parallel Sessions MUST Not Cross-Contaminate

The 4 engine isolation paths MUST remain intact and not cross-contaminate under parallel streaming:

> New requirement added by review pass 2026-06-16 to clarify the engine isolation contract. Codex and Claude code threads use `isClaudeSessionBootstrapThreadId` (`claudeForkThread.ts`); Claude / Gemini / Opencode use `${engine}-pending-` prefix (`threadPendingResolution.ts:18`).

- **codex** threads: identified by `isClaudeSessionBootstrapThreadId(threadId)` from `claudeForkThread.ts`
- **claude** threads: identified by `claude-pending-` prefix in `isPendingThreadForEngine("claude", threadId)`
- **gemini** threads: identified by `gemini-pending-` prefix in `isPendingThreadForEngine("gemini", threadId)`
- **opencode** threads: identified by `opencode-pending-` prefix in `isPendingThreadForEngine("opencode", threadId)`

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):There is **no `codex-pending-` prefix** in the codebase. The original proposal's evidence point citing `codex-pending-` was incorrect; this requirement reflects the actual isolation mechanism.

#### Scenario: 4 engines parallel streaming do not cross-contaminate

- **WHEN** a codex thread and a claude thread stream in parallel
- **THEN** codex's `turnDiagnosticsRef.get(codexThreadId)` MUST NOT contain claude's entries
- **AND** claude's `pendingInterruptsRef[claudeWorkspaceId]` MUST NOT contain codex threadIds
- **AND** `isClaudeSessionBootstrapThreadId` MUST continue to identify codex threads correctly
- **AND** `claude-pending-` / `gemini-pending-` / `opencode-pending-` prefixes MUST continue to identify their respective engine threads

#### Scenario: workspace-scope ref does not collide across workspaces

- **WHEN** `pendingMemoryCaptureRef` is written for `(workspaceA, threadA)` and `(workspaceB, threadA)`
- **THEN** both entries MUST coexist
- **AND** eviction of `threadA` from `workspaceA` MUST NOT affect `workspaceB`'s entry

### Requirement: Chat Stream Budgets MUST Be Enforced

`runtime-performance-evidence-gates` MUST expose 5 `chat.stream.*` budgets in `docs/perf/baseline.json`. The `target` and `hard fail` values for `S-CHAT-100/longConversationFrameP95` MUST be derived from a measured baseline (`baseline * 0.7` and `baseline * 1.4` respectively) — they MUST NOT be hardcoded.

> Note (review pass 2026-06-16):The 16ms / 32ms numbers in earlier drafts were guesses. The baseline measurement (`S-RS-VL2/visibleTextLagP95Streaming`, evidence `proxy`, 500 row + 2 thread parallel streaming 5min) is a prerequisite for sub-task 6.1.

- `S-CHAT-100/longConversationFrameP95`: target `<= baseline × 0.7`, hard fail `> baseline × 1.4`
- `S-CHAT-101/reducerFastPathHitRate`: target `>= 0.85`, hard fail `< 0.6`
- `S-CHAT-102/virtualizerActiveDuringStreaming`: target `true`, hard fail `false`
- `S-CHAT-103/workspaceScopedRefEvictions`: target `0`, hard fail `> 0`
- `S-CHAT-104/transientTimerCleanups`: target `100%`, hard fail `< 100%`

#### Scenario: long conversation frame P95 reported

- **WHEN** `npm run perf:realtime:boundary-guard` runs with a 500-row streaming fixture
- **THEN** `S-CHAT-100/longConversationFrameP95` MUST report a measured value
- **AND** the value MUST be `<= baseline × 0.7` for the fixture
- **AND** the evidence class MUST be `proxy` initially, `measured` after Tauri/WebView collection

#### Scenario: reducer fast path hit rate reported

- **WHEN** 100 assistant text deltas flow through the reducer
- **THEN** `S-CHAT-101/reducerFastPathHitRate` MUST report the fraction that returned prior state reference
- **AND** the value MUST be `>= 0.85` for typical streaming patterns

#### Scenario: budget violations are surfaced

- **WHEN** a budget hard fail is exceeded (e.g. `S-CHAT-102` returns `false`)
- **THEN** `npm run check:runtime-evidence-gates` MUST fail
- **AND** the failure message MUST identify which budget hard-failed

### Requirement: Realtime Event Optimization MUST Preserve Codex Ownership Gates

Realtime batching, raw-event compatibility routing, normalized realtime adapters, and late-event suppression MUST preserve Codex event ownership gates. Performance optimizations MUST NOT allow stale or ambiguous events to recreate processing state after terminal settlement.

#### Scenario: batched late event cannot revive terminal Codex turn
- **WHEN** realtime event batching flushes a Codex event after the target turn has completed, failed, stalled, or been abandoned
- **THEN** the flush MUST respect terminal/quarantine state
- **AND** it MUST NOT mark the thread processing or append lifecycle-visible progress for the old turn

#### Scenario: raw and normalized paths share ownership semantics
- **WHEN** equivalent Codex activity is received through raw app-server compatibility routing or normalized realtime routing
- **THEN** both paths MUST apply equivalent owner checks before lifecycle mutation
- **AND** neither path MAY use active UI selection as lifecycle ownership proof

#### Scenario: optimization preserves explicit owner priority
- **WHEN** a batched or coalesced Codex event includes explicit thread and turn ownership
- **THEN** optimization MAY defer or coalesce processing
- **AND** final mutation MUST still route to the explicit owner rather than the active conversation at flush time

#### Scenario: owner decision is made before coalesced mutation
- **WHEN** multiple realtime events are coalesced for render or reducer efficiency
- **THEN** each lifecycle-sensitive Codex event MUST carry or resolve its owner before mutation
- **AND** a later active-thread selection change MUST NOT change the event target during flush

### Requirement: Ownership Hardening MUST Preserve Non-Codex Engine Realtime Semantics

Codex ownership gates MUST NOT regress Claude Code, Gemini, or OpenCode realtime semantics. Shared batching and adapter utilities MAY be reused only when engine-specific behavior remains unchanged.

#### Scenario: Claude Code legacy single channel still routes under batching
- **WHEN** app-server event batching is enabled
- **AND** Claude Code emits legacy single-channel agent delta or turn completion events with explicit `threadId`
- **THEN** those events MUST continue routing to the Claude thread
- **AND** Codex ownership fallback rules MUST NOT suppress them

#### Scenario: Claude normalized events preserve explicit completion
- **WHEN** Claude Code normalized realtime events include explicit thread and turn identity
- **THEN** completion and context usage semantics MUST remain unchanged
- **AND** Codex-specific settled-turn quarantine MUST NOT be applied as a Claude lifecycle rule

#### Scenario: Gemini and OpenCode adapters remain non-fatal
- **WHEN** Gemini or OpenCode receives unknown or unsupported realtime methods
- **THEN** adapter behavior MUST remain non-fatal according to existing engine contracts
- **AND** Codex ownership diagnostics MUST NOT convert those events into lifecycle errors

#### Scenario: multi-engine batching remains lossless
- **WHEN** Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, or OpenCode realtime events are batched or flushed under streaming pressure
- **THEN** accepted events MUST remain ordered and lossless within their thread/item lineage
- **AND** Codex ambiguous-event suppression MUST NOT drop explicit non-Codex events

### Requirement: Realtime Regression Tests MUST Cover Both Performance And Ownership Semantics

Realtime optimization tests MUST cover ownership-sensitive behavior so future performance changes do not reintroduce Codex session contamination.

#### Scenario: existing performance contracts remain green
- **WHEN** Codex ownership hardening is implemented
- **THEN** existing realtime adapter, batcher, and history parity tests for Codex/Claude/Gemini/OpenCode MUST remain green
- **AND** reducer/render optimization semantics MUST remain lossless

#### Scenario: late-event regression covers raw and normalized input
- **WHEN** a Codex turn is terminal
- **AND** a late event for the old turn arrives through raw app-server routing or normalized realtime routing
- **THEN** tests MUST prove neither path revives processing state
- **AND** the old terminal turn MUST remain quarantined

#### Scenario: active selection changes cannot affect buffered Codex events
- **WHEN** a Codex event is accepted into a batching or deferred processing path
- **AND** the user switches active thread before the event is flushed
- **THEN** the eventual mutation MUST still target the resolved owner
- **AND** it MUST NOT target the newly active thread

#### Scenario: deferred presentation snapshot cannot cross active conversation scope
- **WHEN** two Codex conversations are processing concurrently
- **AND** the user switches the active tab while one conversation still has a deferred render or presentation snapshot
- **THEN** the newly active conversation MUST render from a snapshot whose scope matches its `workspaceId + threadId`
- **AND** a stable snapshot from the previously active conversation MUST NOT be merged into the new conversation curtain

#### Scenario: same-thread streaming stabilization remains enabled
