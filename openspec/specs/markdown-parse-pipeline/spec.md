# markdown-parse-pipeline Specification

## Purpose

Defines the Markdown parse and precompute pipeline contract for final and live assistant content. Large final Markdown SHOULD use worker-capable serializable precompute with explicit fallback diagnostics, while live streaming fragments MUST stay on the lightweight path and avoid per-delta full rich parsing that would block the renderer.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Large Final Markdown MUST Use Worker-Capable Precompute Or Explicit Fallback

Large final assistant Markdown MUST move serializable heavy precompute off the main thread when thresholds are met, while preserving safe main-thread rich rendering for React-bound features.

#### Scenario: large final message uses worker precompute

- **WHEN** a final assistant message exceeds the documented size or complexity threshold
- **THEN** serializable Markdown precompute MUST run in a worker when worker support is available
- **AND** diagnostics MUST report worker-precompute mode, duration, threshold reason, and evidence class.
- **AND** worker diagnostics MUST include pending request count and fallback count without raw Markdown content

#### Scenario: React-bound rich render remains safe

- **WHEN** Markdown requires React components, sanitized raw HTML, KaTeX, Mermaid, file links, or custom code-block actions
- **THEN** the final rich render MAY still execute through the existing React renderer on the main path
- **AND** worker output MUST NOT be treated as trusted DOM or a substitute for sanitization.

#### Scenario: small final message stays on main path

- **WHEN** a final message is below the documented threshold and lacks heavy complexity signals
- **THEN** the renderer MAY use the existing main path
- **AND** diagnostics MUST make the parse/precompute mode visible.

#### Scenario: worker failure falls back safely

- **WHEN** worker creation fails, worker support is unavailable, or precompute exceeds the documented timeout
- **THEN** the renderer MUST fall back to the existing readable main path
- **AND** fallback reason MUST be reported in diagnostics and runtime evidence.

#### Scenario: stale worker result is dropped

- **WHEN** a worker result resolves after a newer content hash or source version exists for the same message
- **THEN** the stale result MUST be ignored
- **AND** it MUST NOT replace newer visible content.
- **AND** diagnostics MUST identify whether the drop was detected by the worker adapter or by the hook/caller latest-source guard

### Requirement: Markdown Precompute Cache MUST Be Keyed By Content And Renderer Options

Markdown precompute results MUST be cached using content identity and renderer options so unchanged large messages do not repeat serializable heavy work.

#### Scenario: cache hit avoids repeat precompute

- **WHEN** a message is rendered again with the same renderer profile, message id, content hash, options hash, and schema version
- **THEN** cached precompute MUST be reused when still valid
- **AND** diagnostics MUST report `cache-hit` rather than running worker/main precompute again.

#### Scenario: renderer option change invalidates cache

- **WHEN** renderer profile, feature flags, sanitization-affecting options, or schema version changes
- **THEN** the cached precompute MUST be invalidated
- **AND** a new precompute or main-path render MUST run.

#### Scenario: diagnostics remain content-safe

- **WHEN** markdown parse/precompute diagnostics are emitted
- **THEN** they MUST include mode, duration, cache state, content length, content hash, fallback reason, and evidence class
- **AND** they MUST NOT include raw Markdown body, prompt text, assistant body text, tool output body, or file content.

### Requirement: Live Markdown Streaming MUST Preserve Existing Lightweight Behavior

The off-main-thread final Markdown pipeline MUST NOT regress live streaming Markdown protections.

#### Scenario: partial live deltas do not force full parser work

- **WHEN** assistant live Markdown is still incomplete or streaming at high frequency
- **THEN** it MUST continue to use bounded stabilization, lightweight rendering, or readable fallback
- **AND** it MUST NOT run the full rich parser pipeline for every partial fragment.

#### Scenario: final output converges with history restore

- **WHEN** a live message completes and is later restored from history
- **THEN** the final visible Markdown semantics MUST converge across live-completed and history-restore paths
- **AND** worker precompute cache MUST NOT create a divergent final structure.

### Requirement: Markdown Worker Requests MUST Have Bounded Lifecycle Diagnostics

The existing fast Markdown worker adapter MUST expose bounded diagnostics for worker lifecycle, pending requests, fallback, stale result drops, and dispose behavior.

#### Scenario: pending worker requests are observable

- **WHEN** Markdown worker precompute requests are in flight
- **THEN** diagnostics MUST expose `pendingRequestCount`
- **AND** diagnostics MUST NOT include raw Markdown body, prompt text, assistant body text, tool output, or file content

#### Scenario: disposing worker rejects pending requests

- **WHEN** `disposeFastMarkdownWorker()` is called while requests are pending
- **THEN** every pending request MUST be rejected with a bounded error
- **AND** `pendingRequestCount` MUST return to zero
- **AND** diagnostics MUST increment `disposedCount`

#### Scenario: stale worker result is ignored at the owning layer

- **WHEN** a worker result arrives for an older content hash, options hash, schema version, or request ordinal
- **THEN** the result MUST be dropped by the layer that owns latest-source knowledge
- **AND** worker adapter diagnostics MUST only increment adapter-level stale counters when the adapter has an explicit latest-source registry
- **AND** hook/caller diagnostics MUST report hook-level stale visible-result drops when request ordinal guards ignore obsolete promise resolutions
- **AND** visible content MUST remain based on the latest source

#### Scenario: adapter lifecycle diagnostics do not infer UI state

- **WHEN** the worker adapter receives an unknown request id, dispose event, worker error, or postMessage failure
- **THEN** adapter diagnostics MAY update pending, disposed, fallback, unknown-response, or bounded error counters
- **AND** it MUST NOT claim a visible-content stale drop unless it has explicit latest-source inputs

#### Scenario: fallback reason is bounded

- **WHEN** worker creation, worker execution, or worker response handling falls back to the main path
- **THEN** diagnostics MUST include a bounded fallback reason
- **AND** the fallback reason MUST NOT contain conversation or file content

### Requirement: File Preview Fast Markdown Compile MUST Be Cache-Stable Across UI State

Fast Markdown compile results for file preview MUST be keyed by Markdown content identity and renderer options, not by annotation, outline, hover, scroll, theme label, or localized UI state.

#### Scenario: annotation state does not invalidate fast compile cache
- **WHEN** annotation draft, annotation marker, outline collapsed state, hover state, or localized label state changes
- **THEN** the fast Markdown compile cache key MUST remain unchanged for the same Markdown content and renderer options
- **AND** compile work MUST NOT restart solely because of that UI state change.

#### Scenario: renderer option change invalidates cache
- **WHEN** sanitizer-affecting options, renderer profile, bounded line limit, feature flags, schema version, or Markdown content hash changes
- **THEN** the fast Markdown compile cache MUST be invalidated
- **AND** a new compile result MUST be produced or a bounded fallback reason MUST be emitted.

### Requirement: File Preview Compile Diagnostics MUST Include Mount-Safe Metadata

Fast Markdown compile diagnostics MUST expose enough metadata for the file preview to bind outline, source-line anchors, annotation overlay, and heavy block islands without rescanning the full DOM.

#### Scenario: compile result includes source-line anchors
- **WHEN** fast Markdown compile succeeds
- **THEN** the result MUST include source-line anchors or equivalent block metadata with stable ids, source line ranges, and heavy block markers
- **AND** the file preview MUST be able to attach outline navigation and annotation overlay from that metadata without full document DOM scans.

#### Scenario: diagnostics stay content-safe
- **WHEN** compile diagnostics are emitted
- **THEN** they MUST include bounded fields such as duration, profile, cache state, total source lines, total headings, total heavy blocks, and fallback reason
- **AND** they MUST NOT include raw Markdown body, file content, annotation body, prompt text, or assistant text.

### Requirement: Stale File Preview Compile Results MUST Not Replace Current Preview

Asynchronous fast Markdown compile results MUST be ignored when a newer document snapshot or renderer profile supersedes the request.

#### Scenario: stale compile result is dropped
- **WHEN** a fast compile request resolves after the file preview has switched to a newer content hash, document key, renderer profile, or bounded line limit
- **THEN** the stale result MUST be ignored
- **AND** diagnostics MUST increment a bounded stale-result counter or equivalent evidence.

#### Scenario: fallback result is tied to current request
- **WHEN** fast compile fails and returns a fallback reason
- **THEN** the fallback MUST only switch the preview to rich mode if the failing request still matches the current document identity
- **AND** stale fallback results MUST NOT downgrade a newer successful preview.
