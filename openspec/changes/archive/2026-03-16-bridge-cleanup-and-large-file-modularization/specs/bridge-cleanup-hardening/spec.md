## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bridge Command Boundary Segregation
The system SHALL separate Bridge command handlers from domain business services and shared adapters using explicit module boundaries.

#### Scenario: Command layer delegates to domain service
- **WHEN** a Tauri command receives a request
- **THEN** command handler MUST perform request parsing/validation and delegate business execution to a domain service module
- **AND** business logic MUST NOT be implemented directly inside command registration module

### Requirement: Bridge Error Contract Normalization
The system SHALL normalize Bridge errors into stable, typed error envelopes consumable by frontend clients.

#### Scenario: Domain error is surfaced through normalized envelope
- **WHEN** a domain service returns an error
- **THEN** Bridge layer MUST map it to a normalized error structure with stable code/category/message fields
- **AND** frontend-facing command contract SHALL remain backward compatible

### Requirement: Bridge Concurrency and File-Lock Enforcement
The system SHALL enforce mutex and file-lock constraints for Bridge operations that access shared state or file storage.

#### Scenario: Shared state command execution
- **WHEN** a command mutates shared in-memory state or project files
- **THEN** implementation MUST use the required mutex/file-lock guard patterns
- **AND** command execution MUST remain retry-safe for idempotent operations

### Requirement: Bridge Refactor Compatibility
The system SHALL preserve existing command names, argument schemas, and response semantics during modularization.

#### Scenario: Existing command invocation after refactor
- **WHEN** existing frontend invokes a pre-refactor command
- **THEN** command resolution and response shape MUST match previous behavior
- **AND** no migration change SHALL be required on the caller side
